# CKKS Encoder in Java

CKKS (HEAAN) is a Homomorphic Encryption Scheme for approxiate arithmetic. The paper can be found here https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf.

This required the apache commons math library which can be found here https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/. Place the "org" folder into the working directory.

I have implemented the complex vector to polynomial encoding step.
